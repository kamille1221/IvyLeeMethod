# Ivy Lee Method: TOday-DO
* I didn't decide the app name. It can be changed continuously :)

This application inspired from [Ivy Lee Method](https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee).

- Every work day, add up to 6 tasks.
- Reorder tasks by priority.
- Focus first task until task is complete.
- If task is completed, check the task and move on to the second task.
